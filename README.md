Here's how the code works:

The function starts with two pointers, left and right, which are initialized at the beginning and end of the sorted array, respectively.

The while loop continues running as long as the left pointer is less than the right pointer. This ensures that the pointers do not overlap or cross each other.

Within each iteration of the loop, the code calculates the sum of the elements at the current positions of the left and right pointers.

If the current sum is equal to the target sum X, it means a valid pair is found. The count is incremented, and both pointers are moved towards each other to consider the next possible pair.

If the current sum is less than the target sum X, it means the sum needs to be increased. Thus, the left pointer is moved to the right to consider a larger element.

If the current sum is greater than the target sum X, it means the sum needs to be decreased. Thus, the right pointer is moved to the left to consider a smaller element.

The loop continues until the left pointer becomes greater than or equal to the right pointer. At this point, all possible pairs have been considered, and the function returns the final count of pairs found.

This approach takes advantage of the fact that the input array is sorted, allowing us to efficiently explore pairs with different sums using the two-pointer technique.
